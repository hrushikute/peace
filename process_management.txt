hrushi@hrushi-Studio-1450:/proc/sys/kernel$ cat pid_max 
32768

the Maximum process id that can be allocated to the process os pid_max-1

pid_max is configured in /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max file.

So in this case it will be 32768 -1=32767

It is also evenident from the screen shot attached.

As well once the max process id is reached the counter will roll over the lowest available PID and will start again.
